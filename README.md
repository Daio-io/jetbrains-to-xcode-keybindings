# Xcode Key Bindings

## Why?

Because I came from a Jetbrains IDE world and I want the same keyboard shortcuts in Xcode (I know AppCode exists)

## How?

Add these bindings to the correct ```<dict>``` here:

```/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Frameworks/IDEKit.framework/Resources/IDETextKeyBindingSet.plist```

Then open restart/open Xcode and go to:

Xcode -> Preferences and click the Key Bindings tab.

Use the search to find your new bindings and add shortcuts
